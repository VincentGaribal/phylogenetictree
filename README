Phylogenetic trees are representations of evolutive relations between species.

This package works only with lualatex because it relies on lua to parse, build and export the tree.

Theres's a french translation (in fact the original version!) Inside the dtx file. To typeset it, you have to change the value of the \langue macro to anything but "english".
